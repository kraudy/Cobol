# Cobol
Learning Cobol?

# Where to start?

This is the first question i asked to many Cobol developer and the mani answer i got was like: **Get a course from Udemy**. And i was like, Why? Why no one pointed me to someone on youtube with some nice tutorials?

*z16* What is it?


So far, i got enrrolled with https://ibmzxplore.influitive.com/

The ide is **Zowe Explorer**

# Object systems

There is a relation between zos datasets and members to ibm i libraries and members

**PDS**: Partition data sets

Sequeantial datasets are like normal tables with registers
Paritioned datasets are like libraries with members that have registers

So, a dataset is like an object

**JCL** (Job control language) is similar to IBM I **CL** (Control language) in the sense that they are OS specific instrucitons, similar to linux bash commands.

JCL is similar to a CL, where you set up the environmente (files, libraries, overs, etc) before executing a program or just to make the OS do some operations

*job entry subsystem* (JES) may be similar to ibm i Sub systems. When the JCL is submited, it creates a new job (which makes sense) and it is also send to the JES Sub system queue, where it is executed, which also makes sense.
